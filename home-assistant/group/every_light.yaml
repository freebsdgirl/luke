# can't use the automatically generated group for all lights because it includes
# a first gen samsung smartthings outlet.

# do we want to move this to the light type instead of group? i seem to recall
# having some issue with referencing hue groups under the light platform and a
# group.

# todo: maybe don't reference light groups and instead reference individual
# bulbs as long as it's not a hue bulb. hue API limits :((((
